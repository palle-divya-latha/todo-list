# Todo List Application

## Functionality Overview
## Create Task:

### Functionality: 
Allows users to add new tasks to the todo list.
### How it works: 
Users click the "Add Task" button, which opens a modal window where they can input the title, description, and status (To Do, In Progress, Completed) of the task. Upon submitting the form, the new task is added to the list.
## Edit Task:

### Functionality:
Enables users to modify existing tasks.
### How it works: Users click the "Edit" button next to the task they want to modify. This action opens a modal window pre-filled with the task's current details. Users can then update the title, description, and status as needed. After making changes, users click "Save" to apply the modifications.
## Delete Task:

### Functionality:
Allows users to remove tasks from the todo list.
### How it works: 
Users click the "Delete" button next to the task they want to delete. A confirmation modal appears, asking users to confirm the deletion. Upon confirmation, the task is permanently removed from the list.
Search Task:

### Functionality: 
Facilitates searching for tasks based on their titles.
### How it works: 
Users enter search queries into the search bar located at the top of the page. As users type, the application dynamically filters the tasks displayed on the screen to match the search criteria. This feature helps users quickly locate specific tasks within the list.
These functionalities collectively provide users with the ability to manage their todo list effectively, including adding, editing, deleting, and searching tasks to keep track of their tasks and progress.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
